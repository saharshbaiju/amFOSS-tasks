# TimeTickQuiz – A Battle Against the Clock!

## The Premise

Welcome, Recruit! 
   - You've just been enrolled in the prestigious **TimeTick Academy**, where the smartest minds train under pressure to outsmart time itself. Your mission? Build a knowledge weapon, a lightning-fast quiz game that challenges even the sharpest brains with one crucial twist: **a ticking 15-second timer**.


At the heart of the academy lies a powerful ancient relic, the **Open Trivia API**, which houses questions across hundreds of categories. Your task is to tap into its wisdom, create an interface to interact with it, and build your own elite quiz machine. This isn't just about being smart, it's about being fast.

## The Challenge : (TimeTickQuiz)

You're tasked with creating a **command-line quiz game** in Python. But not just any game, one that reacts in real-time, fetches live questions from the web, and tests your reaction speed with every tick.

### Your quiz should:

- Connect to the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/)  
- Allow the player to choose category, difficulty (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`), and type (`multiple`, `true/false`)  
- Run a **15-second timer** per question  
- Display whether the answer was correct immediately  
- Keep track of the score  
- End the game with a final score summary

## What You’ll Learn

- How to work with external **APIs** in Python  
- How to build an interactive **command-line interface (CLI)**  
- How to use **timers and threads** for real-time input
