# TASK-05 : TimeTickQuiz â€“ A Battle Against the Clock!

## MY EXPERIENCE

This task teached me a lot of new things like requests and using api fetched data and the basics of Threading .

It was kinda easy but had learning curve

## TECHNICAL OVERVIEW
I used the _pyfiglet_ for the quiz tittle design

For questions I used open trivia api and fetched question with request module 

And I used threading to make a timed input
