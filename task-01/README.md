# TASK-01 : TERMINAL HUNT  

## MY EXPERIENCE
Even though I had some experience with Linux, I was not used to the CLI at first; but by doing this task, I got the feel of it, became good at using Linux commands (as listed at the end of this MD file), and also became proficient at file traversal using the CLI.
# THE FIRST SOLUTION
- **Found the first key from russia folder using grep command and viewed it by "less"**

You’ve uncovered the first piece of the puzzle — well done, explorer.

**_The string: T25lIGxhc3QgdGFzaywgYW5kIHlvdSdsbCBoYXZlIHN1Y2Nlc3NmdWxseSBjb21_**_

Its meaning holds power... and danger.
Now that the facility has fulfilled its purpose, it's time to cover your tracks, erase it.  
Wipe it from existence so no one — and nothing — can trace your path.
The future depends on secrecy.

But now, your mission isn't just to discover... it's to protect

And what could be safer than your Home Sweet Home
Copy it to the directory that shares the name of your state and also take a screenshot of this output
