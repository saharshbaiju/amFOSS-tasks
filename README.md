# amfoss-tasks

## INTRODUCTION
My name is Saharsh Baiju and I am a first-year BTech student in Computer Science and Engineering (Core) at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri campus. I have some background in coding, mainly with Python at an intermediate level. I enjoy doing some fun coding projects ,drawing ,gym and some rc projects at free time . I try to keep a positive attitude in whatever I do, and if I find myself lacking in something, I make sure to work on it and improve.

## Why should we choose you?
I am consistent and committed when it comes to completing my work. While doing the Praveshan tasks, I tried to stay regular with updates and put in steady effort. I like learning new things, and I don’t mind putting extra hours if required. I also try to look at mistakes as chances to improve, so I believe I can adjust quickly to the challenges I may face. With this mindset, I feel I can contribute well to the club and also grow as a member.

## How do you intend to contribute back to the club?
I plan to be active in the events, discussions, and projects organized by the club. I am not someone who would back out after seeing the workload, because I am ready to spend the time needed to meet the expectations. I also want to take part in competitions and activities outside the campus, which will give me a chance to represent amFOSS and contribute to its reputation while learning in the process.

## What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?
My interests are mainly in coding and technology. Another reason I want to join amFOSS is because I believe it will give me the right environment to improve and explore these areas further.

## What are your thoughts and feedback on the Praveshan Selection Process?
The tasks were challenging but very rewarding. I got to learn something new from each task, and even though it was not always easy, I managed to push through and keep improving. At first, I didn’t expect to get this far, but with time and effort, I  could complete most of the tasks. I am thankful for the gidance given by the mentors. Even if I am not selected, I will still value the things I have learned from this process, because they have already made a difference in the way I approach problems.
