```py
from lrcup import LRCLib

lrclib = LRCLib()

# Fetch synced lyrics via search
results = lrclib.search(
    track = "Never Gonna Give You Up",
    artist = "Rick Astley"
)
print(results[0].syncedLyrics)

# Fetch synced lyrics directly
track = lrclib.get(
    track = "Never Gonna Give You Up",
    artist = "Rick Astley",
    album = "Whenever You Need Somebody",
    duration = 215
)
if track is not None:
    print(track.syncedLyrics)

# Publish synced lyrics
lrclib.publish(
    token = lrclib.request_challenge(),
    track = "Never Gonna Give You Up",
    artist = "Rick Astley",
    album = "Whenever You Need Somebody",
    duration = 215,
    plain_lyrics = "*Rickrolling*",
    synced_lyrics = "[00:00.00] *Rickrolling*"
